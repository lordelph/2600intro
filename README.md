# Programming the Atari VCS 2600 for fun

These are materials for a lighting talk given at [SyncHerts](http://www.meetup.com/SyncHerts/events/225920918/) on 14 Jan 2016. 

## You will need

* [stella](http://stella.sourceforge.net/) - a multi-platform Atari VCS emulator. This is where you'll play and debug your games
* [dasm](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasm-dillon/files/dasm-dillon/2.20.11/) - a macro assember - this turns our 6507 assembly language into a binary file we can run on an Atari emulator like stella.
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or similar is handy if you're already familiar with Makefiles, but you can get by perfectly well without it for a simple project.
* [2600intro](https://github.com/lordelph/2600intro) - this very repository!
