# Programming the Atari VCS 2600 for fun

These are materials for a lightning talk given at [SyncHerts](http://www.meetup.com/SyncHerts/events/225920918/) by [Paul Dixon](http://linkedin.com/in/pjdixon)
on 14 Jan 2016.

The object of the talk was inspire at least one person to try their hand at
Atari 2600 programming just for the interesting challenges it presents. If you're
reading this, I'm glad it piqued your interest - tweet [@lordelph](http://twitter.com/lordelph)
to let me know how you get on!

## You will need

* [stella](http://stella.sourceforge.net/) - a multi-platform Atari VCS emulator. This is where you'll play and debug your games
* [dasm](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dasm-dillon/files/dasm-dillon/2.20.11/) - a macro assember - this turns our 6507 assembly language into a binary file we can run on an Atari emulator like stella.
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or similar is handy if you're already familiar with Makefiles, but you can get by perfectly well without it for a simple project.
* [2600intro](https://github.com/lordelph/2600intro) - this very repository!
* It helps if you can use editor for which you can find some syntax colouring support for
6502 assember - I personally like using [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Documentation and tutorials

* [Stella Programmers Guide by Steve Wright](http://www.alienbill.com/2600/101/docs/stella.html) all the gory details you could need.
* [Atari 2600 for Newbies by Andrew Davie](http://www.randomterrain.com/atari-2600-memories-tutorial-andrew-davie-01.html) an excellent 25 part tutorial taking you through every aspect of writing code for the Atari 2600
* [2600 101 by Kirk Israel](http://www.atariage.com/2600/programming/2600_101/index.html) another great tutorial written by someone writing as they learn.
